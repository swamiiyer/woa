# This script can be used to simulate continuous pairwise games by setting 
# the model parameters to the desired values. 
#
# Usage: python experiment.py [--realtime]
# 
# where the optional --realtime argument runs the simulation in real-time mode 
# instead of the default off-line mode.
# 
# In the off-line mode, the results of simulation are saved in results.pkl 
# file, the plots produced from them are saved in plot*.pdf files. 
# In the real-time mode, results of the simulation are plotted in real time, 
# and are not saved to a file. 
#
# Note that the off-line version can also be used to extend a previously 
# run experiment to include more generations. Also, the real-time version 
# can be used to visualize the results saved from running the off-line version.
# Check continuous_omain.py and continuous_rmain.py for documentation of 
# these features.
